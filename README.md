#SaveObj.h
This is the main header file (also the only .h file). This file contains the methods:
* `void writeObject<T>(T object, const char* fileName)`
* `T readObject<t>(const char* fileName)`

#Demo.cpp
In this demo file I show how to use the functions in SaveObj.h; please take a good look at them!

#TODO
I will add error handling and stuff to the functions in the header file.

#License
I don't have a license, just use it idc.
