This is the main header file (also the only .h file). This file contains the methods:
* `void writeObject<T>(const T* object, const char* fileName)`

# Demo.cpp
In this demo file I show how to use the functions in SaveObj.h; please take a good look at them!

# TODO
* More error handling; please report any errors.
